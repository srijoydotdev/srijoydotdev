### ðŸ§ª currently experimenting with

- ideas that wonâ€™t leave me alone  
- code that breaks at 3am  
- tech that feels like magic  
- projects Iâ€™m not supposed to talk about yet  

---

### ðŸ’­ philosophy

- donâ€™t wait to be ready. just build.  
- make things real, not perfect.  
- code is a canvas. products are poetry.

### ðŸ§° tech stack (lately)

```ts
const stack = [
  "Next.js", "TailwindCSS", "Node.js",
  "Firebase", "FFmpeg", "Markdown",
  "JSON-as-DB", "Sharp", "Turborepo", "Vite"
]
